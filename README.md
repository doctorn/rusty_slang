### Simple language

Compiler implementation to compliment compiler construction course.

Credit to Dr Timothy Griffin for slang examples and [OCaml reference implementation](https://github.com/Timothy-G-Griffin/cc_cl_cam_ac_uk).

To compile a program, you'll need to use `x.sh`.

Example

```
x.sh examples/expr.slang
```

This should give you two files: `expr.s` (the generated assembly) and `expr` the linked binary.
